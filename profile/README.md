## About Us

Flutter needs plugins for tasks that are only possible via Kotlin and iOS. For this purpose, a number of plugins exist on pub.dev, which are often abandoned. OriginOSS is a non-profit organization with the goal to give those plugins a better health and life.

### Our Projects

We support a variety of projects aimed at solving real-world problems. Here are some of our flagship projects:

- **[HTML to PDF](https://github.com/originoss/flutter_html_to_pdf_plus)**: Convert HTML templates to PDF files
